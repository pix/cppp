There are no special installation steps. Just run make to build the
program. By default make install will place cppp under /usr/local;
edit the prefix variable at the top of the Makefile to change this.

The program is written almost entirely in portable C, but there are a
handful of functions it needs that are beyond the standard C library.
(Specifically, functions that work with directories.) These functions
are collected in the file unixisms.c. Porting this file is all that is
needed to port cppp to another platform. An example of a replacement
file is included, named unixisms-win32.c. Replace unixisms.c with this
file to build cppp for windows.
